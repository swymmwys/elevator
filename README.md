# Elevator Simulator
Project aims to simulate real elevator experience. Supports multiplayer.

User has two states: "on the floor" and "inside elevator".

Standing on the floor you can call elevator either "up" or "down".

When you are inside - you can choose any floor (positive or negative value) and the last selected floor will force you out of elevator when it arrives at the floor.
